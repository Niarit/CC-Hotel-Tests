# CC-Hotel-Tests
This repository contains test for the Codecool project named: Grand Hotel Codecool. 

This project was written in a 1 week iteration to test the functionalities of a hotel room booking site, called Grand Hotel Codecool.

The project was in an early stage, with only a few pages like:
- main page
- reservation page
- .
- .

For future maintanability and better understading, this testing projects relies on POM (Page Object Model) styling and BDD, using Gherkin and Cucumber. 
This was neccesery to ensure that the developers - who are not familiar with Selenium - will understand the script entierly.
