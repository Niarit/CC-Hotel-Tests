# CC-Hotel-Tests
This repository contains test for the Codecool project named: Grand Hotel Codecool. 

This project was written in a 1 week iteration to test the functionalities of a hotel room booking site, called Grand Hotel Codecool.

The project was in an early stage, with only a few pages:
- main page
- reservation page
- login page
- admin page (removed in the half of the iteration)

For future maintanability and better understading, this testing projects relies on POM (Page Object Model) styling and BDD, using Gherkin and Cucumber. 
This was neccesery to ensure that the developers - who are not familiar with Selenium - will understand the script entierly.
